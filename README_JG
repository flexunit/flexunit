This project leverages the work done by the team at FlexMojos to produce unit test code coverage reports,
but via the FlexUnit Ant task and CIListener.  The project assumes the license of those projects.

The goal of the project was to fill a need that occurred when the FlexCover project was no longer maintained.
Without FlexCover, the only options for Flex code coverage analysis where to use FlashBuilder or FlexMojos/Maven.
FlashBuilder gave inconsistent results from run to run, and was not an option, in terms of continuous integration
(not to mention the fact that I generally develop on Linux).  FlexMojos would do the trick, but I prefer to use Ant
based builds vs. Maven.

The project source is comprised of a copy of the FlexUnit 4.1.0.8 project with a few of the FlexMojos classes and
dependent libs added in (FlexMojos version 4.3-beta).  Modifications to the source code include my initials ("JG")
in a comment.

To use, make sure to add the CIListener to your FlexUnit test runner class.  Then, within your FlexUnit Ant task,
add the coverage sources and exclusions as child elements, e.g.:

        <flexunit
            workingDir="${build.dir}"
            toDir="${report.dir}"
            swf="${build.dir}/TestRunner.swf"
            haltonfailure="false"
            verbose="true"
            debug="true"
            localTrusted="true"
            port="1024">
            <coverageSource>${src.dir}/swf/</coverageSource>
            <coverageExclude>org.robotlegs</coverageExclude>
            <coverageExclude>org.swiftsuspenders</coverageExclude>
       </flexunit>

The source code provides a working example (under the example_jg directory).  If you are having issues, compare
your project with this sample project.

Currently, I use this guy in all of my automated builds, but I really only use it one way, so your mileage may vary.

If you are not seeing any coverage information, make sure to compile your test swf with debug information and
run the tests with the debug flash player.  This may help provide some info for troubleshooting.
